A help desk management system is a software application that allows organizations to manage and track customer support requests. In PHP, a help desk management system can be developed as a web-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing support tickets.

The system should allow customers to create support tickets, view the status of their tickets, and communicate with support agents. Support agents should be able to view, manage and respond to support tickets, and escalate issues if necessary
